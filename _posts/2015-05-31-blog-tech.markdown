This is the first post "com sci" oriented I've written in this this blog, and I've decided summarize all the stack who keep this tab in your browser running.

When I thought about writing a blog in order to organize my ideas, I was also certain that I wasn't
searching a big cms like [Wordpress][wordpress] or [Drupal][drupal]. My main idea was have a simple place to host my technical experiments, lectures and short stories.

As a [github][githubNewrol] user I read about [github pages][githubpages], a place to lodge your open source project webs. It runs over [Jekyll][jekyll] which is a [Ruby][ruby]  framework developed to create a simple, blog-aware, statics.
[Github][github] uses [Ruby][ruby] around their all platform. So it is a good marriage.

[Jekyll][jekyll] has a lot of different layouts to help you in the visual appearance. In this case I decided only uses [Jekyll][jekyll] to organize all the post and render it in the correct order and in the designed space. Instead of basic layout I used [Material Design Lite][materialDesing] components to develop a simple and responsive interface. In future posts I will write about this two frameworks in deep.

To complement [Github][github] host server I used [Travis][travis] to support me in the continuous integration tests ([Htmlproof][htmlproof] helps me in the html integrity test script. [Htmlproof][htmlproof] detects bad image links and tag failures).

In the libraries downloading and maintaining dependencies areas i uses:

*  **[Npm][npm]** to manage back end dependencies.

  * **[Grunt][grunt]** to run local building.


*  **[Bower][bower]** to manage front end dependencies.

  * **[lightbox2][lightbox2]**
  * **[Material-design-lite][materialDesing]**
  * **[Font-awesome][fontAwesome]**
  * **[Sly][sly]**

[Github pages][githubpages] uses [Flavored Mardown][flavoredMarkdown], a simple text formating render, to help us writing texts.

With this stack we have a simple, organized and out of php writing environment. Some changes coming soon and more above-mentioned technologies will have their own post.
